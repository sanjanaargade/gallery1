	    <h1>Interests</h1>
<p><img src="../blog/images/blog1.JPG" alt="" width="209" height="112" class="floatLeft"/>I really enjoy hanging out with my friends and I always have a good time when I am near them.Some of the things usually do is mostly get food. Some inclue, Crumbl Cookies, Insomnia Cookies, Chic Fil A, and many others.  </p>
	  <p>Some of my other interests consist of reading, wrting, drawing, etc... I usually don't get time to do these things only because of my school work. But on the days I do have some down time I really enjoy reading Colleen Hoover. I like writing but specifically speaking I enjoy journaling. In doing so I am able to not only write down what I am feeling But I am able to figure out who I am as a person.  </p>

	  <h1>Extra</h1>
	  <p><img src="../blog/images/blog2.jpg" width="260" height="300" alt=""/> I babysit and dogsit here and there and I really ejoy doing both. I have wanted a dog for years now but that wasn't possible but I know for a fact when I am older I will own one. This year I had recently been into cats. I love cats and I used to be anti-cat before. But I know for a fact I want a cat also. </p>
	  <p>Ever since I was younger I always knew what I wanted. Not necessarily what I wanted to do in life but the things I wanted to have and achieve. I want to live in a big city and I want to own at least one dog and one cat and a fish. I am into interior design but only for fun and I don't see myself persuing something in that, same goes for drawing. I want to travel the world. My family and I have been travelling for many years now. I have gotten the amazing opportunity to visit many countries and I would love to continue the journey as I get older. </p>
